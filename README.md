# Speech Technology Reading Group

We aim to read and discuss papers related to speech processing, language learning, educational use of speech tech, and applications of speech data in AI. Our objectives are:
1. To engage with technical papers and see what interventions linguists can make to improve research outcomes
2. To present research on speech, linguistics, or second language learning and discuss the possibility of building computational models to achieve the goals described therein (for example: CALL)
3. Arrange mini workshops to explain the commonly used acoustic features, techniques, and models in the speech field (e.g., wav2vec, Kaldi, HuBERT, etc) to facilitate knowledge-sharing
4. To find intersection between Natural Language Processing and Speech Technology for when discussing work on human communication
