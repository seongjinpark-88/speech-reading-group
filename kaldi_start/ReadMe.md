To get started:
1. Run `setup_kaldi.sh`. Read the commands in there carefully for further instructions
2. run `prepare_stt.sh`. This will create a directory `forced_alignment`.
3. Run `create_data.py`. Change the file directories in the python script to provide correct input. Output files will be saved in `forced_alignment/data/example/`
